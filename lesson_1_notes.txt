Git roughly means 'unpleasant person' in British Slang
	- it was created by Linus Torvalds "I'm an egotistical bastard and I name all my projects after myself"

Hg (mercurial) is similar to Git

SVN and CVS are other version control systems

Dropbox, Google Docs, and Wikipedia all have built-in version control

It is recommended to try and limit a commit to one logical change. It seems like even with this, the number of saved commits could quickly grow seemingly out of control. An upside is that the fewer changes you make for a given commit, the easier the diff is to interpret.

Git tracks across multiple files. A repository is defined as a collection of related files that all get 'captured' in each commit. When you do a diff, this is performed across all files, so you can see the changes that were present in each file and do a better job of tracking changes across files.

"git clone" copies an entire repository from one computer to another

Version control gives you the confidence to explore with the code

diff <old_file> <new_file>
scp
	secure copy


git diff <older commit_id> <newer commit_id>
	difference between two commits in a Git repo. Similar to diff, but only works when invoked on git repos
	shows minus (-) sign next to lines that were removed from older commit, and plus (+) sign next to lines that were added
git clone
	make a copy of an entire Git repo, including its history, on your hard drive
git log
	show the commits (with comments) made in a repo
	-- stat command shows additional statistics pertaining to which files have been changed

git checkout <commit_id>
	temporarily reset all files in a repo to the state they were in during a previous commit

git status
	shows any files that have yet to be stages, or that have been modified since the last commit
git stash
	'stashes' any files that you have changes since the last commit in a separate directory to come back to later
