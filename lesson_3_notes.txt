Git has the concept of a 'remote repository' (also called a 'remote'), which is the known location of a repository that you will want to pull changes from and push changes to

When you push and pull from a remote repository, it is often easy to specify a particular branch. not every commit is pushed or pulled for a specific branch - only those commits that are not already stored on the remote or in the local repo

git remote
	can be run to view current remotes
	-v command shows what URLs are associated with each remote

git remote add <name> <URL>
	when you have one remote, it is most common to name it origin

git push <remote> <branch>
	push all changes from the currently checked-out branch to the indicated remote
	wonder if there is a way to see what changes will be pushed?

git pull <remote> <branch>
	pulls the specified branch from the specified remote to your local copy
